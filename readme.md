Make sure you installed [git](http://git-scm.com/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
 npm install
 grunt server
```
